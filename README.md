## Tested with ...
Tested with Chrome Version 89.0.4389.90, Firefox Version 86.0.1 and Edge 89.0.774.57

1) Chrome: works as expected
2) Firefox: works nicely except refreshing the page. I could'nt find a fix for that. However a workaround is to press cmd+F5 to refresh.
3) Edge: works as expected

## Style changes in css
1) body backround color set to dark grey
2) card background set to light grey
3) header title color set to (close to) white

## exceed 
1) search field works dynamic by using a keyup listener 
2) removed magnifying glass for aestethic reasons. It also would have no function anyways.
3) the next and prev buttons have "cycle-through" behavior. E.g. after the last person it starts from the first person. 

## other 
staff number is parametrizable in first line of script.js
